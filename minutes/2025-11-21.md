## Minutes

- James created a Github repository for the project
- We need to see how to set up RStudio with version control and make sure everyone is comfortable using it

- looking at the data:
	- Could try to make predictions such as the level of danceability by looking at just the tempo, loudness, genre for example
- Might be helpful to do some EDA
- There are some "tracks" that are not songs, i.e. name contains "- Commentary"

- Next meeting;
	- Monday - 6:30pm
	- Discord meeting
	- Find 1 or 2 things about the data that you want to research before this meeting
