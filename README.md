# Data-Vis-Shiny-Project

## Summary
This project explores the Spotify song attributes data set, which contains over 160,000 songs from Spotify's song library. Using the data set we constructed a shiny application that allows the user to visually explore the data set. The user will be able to manipulate plot features through a drop down menu, so they can see how different attributes correlate with one another in a clean and friendly way.
